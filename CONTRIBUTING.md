## 🛠️ Overview of Our Development Workflow

For a quick reference, here are the core expectations for contributing:

### 1. Claiming an Issue
Before writing any code, find an issue in the **Issues** tab.
- Filter by `good-first-issue` if you are new.
- Comment **"I'd like to work on this!"** on the issue thread.
- Wait until a maintainer assigns the issue to you before starting work.

### 2. Branching & Commits
- Base your work on the `develop` branch.
- Use **Conventional Commits** for commit messages (e.g. `feat(ingest): add contract event parsing`, `fix(admin): repair network error handling`).

### 3. Running Code Validation
Before staging your commits, run the formatters and tests:

#### Python / Django:
```bash
cd django-backend
black .
ruff check .
pytest
```

#### TypeScript / Next.js:
```bash
cd soroscan-frontend
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

#### Rust / Soroban:
```bash
cd soroban-contracts/soroscan_core
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

### 4. Submitting a Pull Request
- Open your PR against the `develop` branch of the upstream repository.
- Complete the PR description template.
- Ensure all CI workflows pass.
- Address code review comments constructively. Once resolved, the reviewer will approve the PR, and it will be merged via **Squash & Merge**.
